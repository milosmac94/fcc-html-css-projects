# fcc-projects
My first repository - purpose is to hold all FreeCodeCamp projects that I've completed in order to keep track of my personal progress and figure out GitHub workflow.
All projects are made in pure html and css.
Pay no mind to terrible design, focus was solely on completing fcc user stories and learning along the way.
