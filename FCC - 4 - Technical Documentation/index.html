                </header>
                <p>There are several types of documentation available on this website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API reference documentation</li>
                    <li>ES6 features</li>
                    <li>Guides</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>API Reference Documentation</h3>
                <p>The API reference documentation provides detailed information about a function or object in Node.js. This documentation indicates what arguments a method accepts, the return value of that method, and what errors may be related to that method. It also indicates which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.</p>
                <p>This documentation describes the built-in modules provided by Node.js. It does not document modules provided by the community.</p>

                    <h2>ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Node.js is built against modern versions of V8. By keeping up-to-date with the latest releases of this engine, we ensure new features from the JavaScript ECMA-262 specification are brought to Node.js developers in a timely manner, as well as continued performance and stability improvements.</p>
                <p>All ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features are split into three groups for shipping, staged, and in progress features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All <b>shipping features</b>, which V8 considers stable, are turned on by default on Node.js and do NOT require any kind of runtime flag.</li>
                    <li><b>Staged features</b>, which are almost-completed features that are not considered stable by the V8 team, require a runtime flag: <code>--harmony</code>.</li>
                    <li><b>In progress</b> features can be activated individually by their respective harmony flag, although this is highly discouraged unless for testing purposes. Note: these flags are exposed by V8 and will potentially change without any deprecation notice.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Which features ship with which Node.js version by default?</h3>
                <p>The website node.green provides an excellent overview over supported ECMAScript features in various versions of Node.js, based on kangax's compat-table.</p>
                <h3>Which features are in progress?</h3>
                <p>New features are constantly being added to the V8 engine. Generally speaking, expect them to land on a future Node.js release, although timing is unknown.
                    You may list all the in progress features available on each Node.js release by grepping through the <code>--v8-options</code> argument. Please note that these are incomplete and possibly broken features of V8, so use them at your own risk:</p>
                <code>node --v8-options | grep "in progress"</code>
                <h3>How do I find which version of V8 ships with a particular version of Node.js?</h3>
                <p>Node.js provides a simple way to list all dependencies and respective versions that ship with a specific binary through the process global object. In case of the V8 engine, type the following in your terminal to retrieve its version:</p>
                <code>node -p process.versions.v8</code>
            </section>

                    <h2>v8.12.0 API how-to-use</h2>
                </header>
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <code>node [options] [V8 options] [script.js | -e "script" | - ] [arguments]</code>
                <p>An example of a web server written with Node.js which responds with 'Hello World!':

                    Commands displayed in this document are shown starting with $ or > to replicate how they would appear in a user's terminal. Do not include the $ and > character they are there to indicate the start of each command.

                    There are many tutorials and examples that follow this convention: $ or > for commands run as a regular user, and # for commands that should be executed as an administrator.

                    Lines that donâ€™t start with $ or > character are typically showing the output of the previous command.

                    Firstly, make sure to have downloaded and installed Node.js. See this guide for further install information.

                    Now, create an empty project folder called projects, navigate into it: Project folder can be named base on user's current project title but this example will use projects as the project folder.</p>
                <code>
    const http = require('http');

    const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
    const port = 3000;

    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World!\n');
    });

    server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
    });
                </code>
